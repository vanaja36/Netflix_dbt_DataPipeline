## 🎬 Netflix Viewing Data Analytics Pipeline (Ongoing)
# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and build a modern data transformation pipeline using dbt (Data Build Tool) on the Netflix dataset.
The goal is to transform raw Netflix data (movies, users, ratings, genres) into a clean star-schema model for analysis, and generate business insights such as most-watched genres, top-rated movies, and user viewing behavior.

Currently, the project is under development 🚧 (Ongoing).

# 🏗️ Architecture

Data Flow:

Raw Data → Netflix dataset (movies, ratings, users, genres).

Staging Models (dbt) → Clean, standardize, and structure raw tables.

Star Schema Models (dbt) → Create fact and dimension tables.

Fact: Ratings, Viewing History

Dimension: Movies, Users, Genres

Data Quality Tests (dbt) → Null checks, unique keys, referential integrity.

Analytics Layer → SQL queries + BI dashboards (Power BI / Tableau / Looker).

# 🔑 Key Features

dbt Transformations → Create modular SQL models for data cleaning & transformations.

Data Modeling → Implemented Star Schema (fact & dimension tables).

Incremental Models → Designed for scalable processing of new data.

Testing & Documentation → dbt built-in tests for data quality + autogenerated docs.

Business Insights (planned):

Top genres by viewing hours

Highest-rated movies by region

User rating distribution patterns

Trends in Netflix viewing over time

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

dbt (Data Build Tool) – SQL transformations & modeling
